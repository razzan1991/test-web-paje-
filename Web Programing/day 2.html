Hyakumanben Campus was established in 2004 as a base for education and research. Most of the lectures will be held in this school building, and many professors as well as students will gather there. Kyoto University is near-by, and the neighborhood is the center of the student town of Kyoto. Passion for learning and free spiritedness are in the air In the past, we used this location as the Large Computer Center of Kyoto Computer Gakuin, where students learned using the "UNIVAC Vanguard" as their practical machines.
